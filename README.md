# Code-Wars-301n11
Code War challenge and solutions created via new branch as needed.  

[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/codefellows/code-of-conduct)

## Code Wars Challenge

-Partners: James Kevin O'Halloran

Complete [today's Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/disemvowel-trolls) and follow the submission instructions below.

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
